									Hi! My name is Christopher Look and I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, planning to graduate 2020. I am pursuing a double degree in computer science and bioengineering.  <br /> <br /> When I'm not working, you'll find me singing, fiddling with a guitar, or playing badminton. My dream however, is to one day run my own biotech company. As cliche as it sounds, I want to do the world some good through my passion.						</p>

											I and a group of bioengineers founded Synapto. One in three seniors citizens die with Alzheimer's or another type of dementia. We want to help solve that problem by making presymptomatic Alzheimer's diagnosis cheaper, faster, and more accessible. We use emerging electroencelphalogram (EEG) technology to read brainwaves and diagnose. We won first place at the Design by Biomedical Undergraduate Teams (DEBUT) challenge and were awarded $20,000 for our work. We are also finalists for the 2017 Biomedical Engineering Society Design Challenge (BMES),and will be attending the BMES conference in Phoenix, Arizona in October. We were featured in Science Magazine, The Washingtonian, ABC news, and more. Our website is found <a href="http://synapto.io" target="_blank">here</a>.

											I and my partner Sanna Madan co-founded Senvision, my proudest failure. My co-founder and I used sentiment analysis on Twitter and news data to predict stock market movement, and provide that investment tool to millennials. We were accepted into Terp startup, UMD's accelerator, and were awarded $4,000. <br /> We learned however, that our business model was unsustainable (millenials are not the richest people in the world), and we made a no-go decision on the business. We still have our algorithm, which was able to make 4.5% returns in 3 months with our own money, over two times more than the benchmark of 2.2%. We are now looking to sell the algoritm for royalty. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in learning more.
