				</header>
				<p align="left">
					Hi! My name is Christopher Look and I am a computer science biognengineering double degree at the University of Maryland, planning to graduate in 2020. My dream is to one day run my own biotech company. As cliche as it sounds, I want to do good through my passion. When I am not working, you can find me singing, fiddling with a guitar, or playing badminton. I feel that my best work arises when I am physically and mentally happy.
					<br /> <br />
					Reading is another one of my favorite past times. The last couple books I read were The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. Please feel free to recommend any books, I am always open to any suggestions.</p>

					I and a group of bioengineers founded Synapto. Currently, Alzheimer's is always diagnosed post symptomatically, leaving little chance for planning and success for drugs. We want to help solve that problem by making presymptomatic Alzheimer's diagnosis cheaper, faster, and more accessible. We use emerging electroencelphalogram (EEG) technology to read brainwaves and diagnose the disease. We won first place at the Design by Biomedical Undergraduate Teams (DEBUT) challenge and were awarded $20,000 for our work. We are also finalists for the 2017 Biomedical Engineering Society Design Challenge (BMES),and attended the BMES conference in Phoenix, Arizona in October. We also spoke as an invited speaker at the ISPE conference in Bethesda, MD. The CTO and I will be speaking as the final keynote speaker at the PharmaMES conference in Berlin, Germany. We were featured in Forbes, Science Magazine, The Washingtonian as well a short 5 minute <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freethinkmedia/videos/1662353797157315/" target="_blank">documentary</a> by Freethink that has over 400k views. Our website is found <a href="http://synapto.io" target="_blank">here</a>. We are currently looking for funding. Feel free to reach out if you have any inquiries.

							I and my partner Sanna Madan co-founded Senvision, a company that failed and my best learning experience. We used sentiment analysis on Twitter and news data to predict stock market movement, and provided that investment tool to millennials. We were accepted into Terp startup, UMD's startup accelerator, and were awarded $4,000. <br /> We learned however, that our business model was unsustainable (millenials are not the richest people in the world), and we made a no-go decision on the business. We still have our algorithm, which was able to make 4.5% returns in 3 months with our own money, over two times more than the benchmark of 2.2%. We are now looking to license the algorithm or sell its signals. You can find the website <a href="http://senvision.io" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in learning more.
